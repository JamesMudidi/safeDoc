                2.6 Information Collected With Cookies.
            </h5>
            Company uses cookies on certain pages of our Site.
            Cookies are small text files sent from a website to the hard drive of a user’s
            computer to store bits of information related to that user, making using the
            Internet easier by, among other things, saving your preferences for you. For example,
            a cookie lets the Site remember that you have registered, which allows us to speed up
            your future activities at our Site, and which allows you to enter your registration
            information less frequently while visiting our Site. We may also use cookies to deliver
            content tailored to your interests. Our cookies may enable us to relate your use of our
            Site to Personal Information that you previously submitted, such as calling you by name
            when you return to our Site. If your browser is set to reject cookies, or if your
            browser notifies you that you are about to receive a cookie and you reject it, then
            your use of the Site may not be as eﬃcient or as enjoyable as it would be if the
            cookie were enabled. The information that we collect with cookies allows us to
            improve our marketing and promotional efforts, to statistically analyse Site usage,
            to improve our content and product offerings and to customize our Site’s content,
            layout and services. However, we only use information collected with cookies on an
            aggregated basis without the use of any information that identifies you. We also
            have the right to use various tracking software to analyse data to improve our
            service. Any specific name is always anonymized automatically.

                3. Information disclosure and usage
            </h3>
            Company will not share, rent, sell or otherwise disclose any of the Personal

            disclose your Personal Information for purposes such as to provide services

            enable our service providers to perform marketing services on our behalf and
            inform members about our own products or services; to comply with state laws
            and other applicable legal requirements. Moreover, we may be legally obligated
            to disclose Personal Information about you to the government or to third
            parties under certain circumstances, such as in connection with illegal
            activity on our Site or to respond to a subpoena, court order or other
            legal process. The Company reserves the right to release information that
            we collect to law enforcement or other government oﬃcials, as we, in our
            sole and absolute discretion, deem necessary or appropriate.

                4. Security measures employed by the Site
            </h3>
            Our Site requires users to give us unique identifiers in order to log into
            many areas of the Site. We utilize these unique identifiers to verify the user’s
            identity and eligibility, in order to protect our members from the release of
            sensitive or Personal Information to unauthorized users. To help protect the
            privacy of data you transmit through this Site, where Personal Information is
            requested, we also use technology designed to encrypt the information that you
            input before it is sent to us using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology or
            similar encryption technology. In addition, the Company takes other reasonable
            physical, technical and organizational steps to protect the user data we collect
            against unauthorized access. However, you should keep in mind that this Site and
            our services are run on software, hardware and networks, any component of which
            may, from time to time, require maintenance or experience problems or breaches
            of security beyond our control.
            <br>
            <br>
            Please also be aware that despite our best intentions and the guidelines outlined
            in this Privacy Policy, no data transmission over the Internet or encryption method
            can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.

                5. Accessing, updating, or making corrections to information

            You may access, correct or update Personal Information collected about you by
            managing your account profile or by contacting us at the email or mailing address
            noted below. We will use reasonable efforts to update our records. For our records,
            we may retain original and updated information for reasons such as technical
            constraints, dispute resolution, troubleshooting and agreement enforcement.
            <br>
            <br>
            Your rights to access your Personal Information are not absolute, and the Company
            may deny access when: denial of access is required or authorized by law, when
            granting you access would have an unreasonable impact on other member’s privacy
            (unless we can sever the requested information from the Personal Information of
            others), and to protect our confidential commercial information. If we deny your
            request for access to, or refuse a request to correct information, we will explain
            why.
