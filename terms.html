                2. No Doctor Patient Relationship
            </h3>
            No doctor-patient relationship with duty of care is created by using information
            provided by or through the use of the site, links to other sites or any assistance
            we may provide to help you find an appropriate medical professional or specialist
            in any field.

            <h3 class="services__title">
                3. Reliance on safeDoc Medical Assessment
            </h3>
            You acknowledge and agree that safeDoc’s opinion forms the best judgement based
            upon the information you submitted and can only serve as a guide and as an opinion
            of the medical situation but not an alternative to an in-person physician
            consultation aided by proper history, physical examination and first hand review,
            analysis and interpretation of diagnostic testing.. safeDoc at this time will not
            provide diagnoses and treatments.
            <br>
            <br>
            <h3 class="services__title">
                4. Consultative Service
            </h3>
            The purpose of the service provided through the Site is to give patients and their 
            physicians access to additional information which they may or may not choose to 
            utilize in planning medical care. It is not a substitute for primary care. The 
            service provided through the Site varies by condition and by state of residence 
            of the patient with special emphasis on providing a medical opinion (which is NOT 
            a medical diagnosis and cannot substitute the advice of a licensed medical doctor 
            in your jurisdiction). In some cases the online nature of the service will make it 
            diﬃcult to verify a medical opinion (particularly with conditions that rely heavily 
            on direct physician-patient interaction for accurate opinion). In those cases, 
            the service provided through the Site will focus on the assessment or recommendation 
            of treatment options.
            <br>
            <br>
            The service provided through this Site differs from the diagnostic services typically 
            provided by a physician. safeDoc will not have the benefit of information that would 
            be obtained by examining you in person and observing your physical condition. Therefore, 
            safeDoc may not be aware of facts or information that would affect the medical opinion 
            issued. To reduce the risk to you of this limitation, the Company strongly encourages 
            you to discuss the medical opinion with your physician. By deciding to engage the 
            services of this Site, you acknowledge and agree that you are aware of this limitation 
            and agree to assume the risk of this limitation. Furthermore, you agree and accept that: 
            <br>
            (i) the diagnosis you will receive is limited and provisional; 
            <br>
            (ii) the medical opinion is not intended to replace a full medical evaluation or an i
            n-person visit with a physician; 
            <br>
            (iii) the medical professionals providing services through this Site do not have 
            important information that is usually obtained through a physical examination; and 
            <br>
            (iv) the absence of a physical examination may affect the medical professional’s 
            ability to diagnose your condition, disease or injury. You also agree that the second 
            opinion will not be used in any legal dispute including but not limited to litigation, 
            arbitration, claim for disability benefits, claim for worker’s compensation and/or 
            malpractice claims without the prior written consent of the Company.

            </h3>
            Our Site requires users to give us unique identifiers in order to log into many areas of

            Company takes steps to protect the user data we collect against unauthorized access. 
            However, you should keep in mind that this Site and our services are run on software, 
            hardware and networks, any component of which may, from time to time, require maintenance 
            or experience problems or breaches of security beyond our control.
            <br>
            You must exercise caution, good sense and sound judgement in using this Site. You are 
            prohibited from violating, or attempting to violate, the security of this Site. Any 
            such violations may result in criminal and/or civil penalties against you. The Company 
            may investigate any alleged or suspected violations and if a criminal violation is 
            suspected, the Company will cooperate with law enforcement agencies in their investigations.

            insurance reimbursement at this time. Major credit cards (MasterCard, Visa) and Online 
            Payment Methods (Paypal) are the only accepted methods of payment.. When you pay by 
            credit card, you hereby authorize the Company to bill and charge the credit card 
            indicated in your order for any fees and any other amounts provided for in your order 
            as the same become due and payable. In the event that your credit card expires or the 
            Company is otherwise unable to debit the applicable amounts from your credit card, the 
            Company shall provide notice to you, whereupon you shall immediately furnish the Company 
            with a valid credit card account number. Your request for services from this Site will 
            not be fulfilled until full payment has been received and/or verified. This does not mean 
            that service providers can not receive payments in the form of cash, cheques, money order 
            or insurance reimbursement.
